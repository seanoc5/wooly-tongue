It is spoken by the Dothraki, a nomadic people in the series\\'s fictional world. The language was developed for the TV series by the linguist David J. Peterson, working off the Dothraki words and phrases in Martin\\'s novels.\\n\\n, the language comprised 3163 words, not all of which have been made public. In 2012, 146 newborn girls in the United States were named \"Khaleesi\", the Dothraki term for the wife of a \\'\\'khal\\'\\' or ruler, and the title adopted in the series by Daenerys Targaryen. Dothraki and Valyrian have been described as \"the most convincing fictional tongues since Elvish\".\\n\\n==Development==\\nDavid J. Peterson, creator of the Dothraki spoken language for \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'\\n\\nThe Dothraki vocabulary was created by David J. Peterson well in advance of the adaptation. HBO hired the Language Creation Society to create the language, and after an application process involving over 30 conlangers, Peterson was chosen to develop the Dothraki language. He delivered over 1700 words to HBO before the initial shooting.

He went on to create the Valyrian languages for season 3 of \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'.  Peterson and his development of Dothraki were also featured on the January 8, 2017 episode of \\'\\'To Tell the Truth\\'\\'.\\n\\n===Language constraints===\\nThe Dothraki language was developed under two significant constraints.  First, the language had to match the uses already put down in the books. Secondly, it had to be easily pronounceable or learnable by the actors. These two constraints influenced the grammar and phonology of the language: for instance, as in English, there is no contrast between aspirated and unaspirated stops.\\n\\n==Phonology and romanization==\\nDavid Peterson has said, \"You know, most people probably don\\'t really know what Arabic actually sounds like, so to an untrained ear, it might sound like Arabic.

The music consultant for HBO and music supervisor of ''Game of Thrones'' Evyen Klean then suggested Ramin Djawadi to David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Djawadi, although initially interested, declined the offer three days later as the schedule conflicted with a film project he was working on.  However, after a few meetings, Djawadi was persuaded to take on the project. The showrunners Benioff and Weiss sent Djawadi the first two episodes of the series, which impressed Djawadi. He arranged a meeting with Benioff and Weiss to discuss the concept of the series, after which he began to compose the music for the series.\\n\\nAccording to Djawadi, Benioff and Weiss were interested in using music to support the different characters and plots.  They wanted the music to express the emotion and mood of each scene in the series, and that distinct themes should be created for the main characters. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 1}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '12f9a249200a1a1f9495f2acd432fd77'}>,\n",

Cello became a prominent feature of the music of \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\', notably in its title theme.\\n\\n===Composition and recording===\\nThe process of composition is essentially the same throughout the series. Once the filming is nearly completed, episodes are sent to Djawadi either singly or in batches of multiple episodes as they were being edited together but often before any special effects added to the footage.  Benioff and Weiss would also inform Djawadi in advance of the need to expand a theme or create new themes for characters. Djawadi wrote all the music in Santa Monica, California. Asked in interview about the overall process of composing the music and how it is used in the series, Djawadi said: \"I sit with David and Dan and we do what\\'s called a spotting session where we watch the entire episode and then discuss when music should start and stop. Everybody\\'s very involved with that. And it constantly gets played with.

After Djawadi had seen the preliminary animated title sequence the visual effect artists were still working on, he was inspired to write the piece. Djawadi said he intended to capture the overall impression of the series with the theme tune.

House Lannister has an associated song, \"The Rains of Castamere\", which became their theme.  The song was played at the Red Wedding, but first heard when Tyrion Lannister whistled a small part in the first episode of the second season.  When a theme has become established, different versions that are darker or lighter are then introduced, and concepts such as honor and conspiracy are also represented in themes.\\n\\nDjawadi chose distinctive sounds and instruments for different leitmotifs and themes, for example, didgeridoos are used for the wildlings, while the Armenian duduk flute is used for the Dothrakis.

The theme music for the White Walker extended over time into the music of the Army of the Dead, representing the gathering strength of Army of the Dead, which was only introduced in full in the finale of the seventh season when the Wall fell.\\n\\nThe themes may evolve over time in the series.  The theme for Daenerys Targaryen started small, but became grander as she became more powerful. Her theme was initially played with a single instrument such as a processed cello, but later began incorporating more instruments, including Japanese taiko-inspired drums, Indonesian bedug drums, and an Armenian duduk flute.

For example, in Season 5, the music for House of Black and White is an extension from the themes for Arya and Jaqen H'ghar. During the first scene of the fourth season, as Ice, the Stark sword, is reforged by Tywin Lannister, the Starks' and Lannisters' themes are clearly played simultaneously, to finally end with the Lannister theme only.

He helps defend Castle Black against the wildlings' initial attacks despite his lack of men and weapons. Ygritte is killed in the fighting, leaving Jon stricken. When the battle is won, Jon is arrested for desertion by Thorne and Janos Slynt, but is freed after convincing the judges of his loyalty. Still suspicious, Thorne orders that Jon be sent to kill Mance under the pretense of parley, but Jon's task is interrupted by the arrival of Stannis Baratheon's army.

Though greatly tempted at the prospect of becoming a true Stark, Jon again chooses to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows.

In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14 deaths.\\n\\n===Themes===\\n\\nThe series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre.

Just like people\\'s capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story. Benioff said, \"George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy. He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe.\"In early seasons, under the influence of the \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.

Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval Europe, from lands and cultures, to the palace intrigue, feudal system, castles, and knightly tournaments. A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) between the houses of Lancaster and York, reflected in Martin\\'s houses of Lannister and Stark. The scheming Cersei Lannister evokes Isabella, the \"she-wolf of France\" (1295–1358).

The game's primary designer is Eric Lang, the lead developer is Nate French, with Damon Stone serving as associate designer.\\n\\nIn the game, players assume the leadership of one of the great houses of Westeros vying for control of King's Landing and the Iron Throne. To accomplish this, players launch military attacks against their opponents, undermine their opponents’ plans with intrigues of their own, and make power plays to win the support of the realm.\\n\\n==Factions==\\nEach house represents one of the main factions involved in the struggle for the Iron Throne emulated by the AGoT LCG. Each house provides different strengths and weaknesses, allowing for various play styles to interact within the same game.

Sometimes these cards follow a special theme for the tournament, but that is not always the case. Usually the cards can legally be included in any deck, but some are marked with a skull icon to indicate they cannot be included unless special rules are in effect for that tournament.\\n\\n===Tournaments===\\nThere are several different official tournament types sanctioned by FFG. In the ''Classic'' format, players bring their own decks, which may include cards from any set, as long as the card is not on the banned list. In ''Standard'' format, players bring their own decks, which may only include cards from the most recent blocks. , only cards released since Valyrian block are legal in Standard format. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 22}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '4deeac004cea41f76eac8478ebd1d40e'}>,\n",
