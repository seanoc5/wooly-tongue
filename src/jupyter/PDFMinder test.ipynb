      "of 3.7% with the expected use of 6.6% in Fall 2024, this represents rapid growth in AI use over \n",

      "\n",
      "1.  The rate of AI use by firms in producing goods and services is increasing with a use rate \n",
      "\n",
      "of about 3.7% in Fall 2023, about 5.4% in February 2024 and expected to rise to about \n",
      "6.6% by Fall 2024. The rate of AI use on an employment-weighted basis is higher and \n",
      "expected to rise to about 12% by Fall 2024.  The increase from Fall 2023 to expected use \n",
      "in Fall 2024 implies rapid growth of AI use by businesses.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2.  AI use exhibits substantial variation across sectors and states. Notably, the Information \n",
      "\n",
      "sector (NAICS 51) is leading in use rate at 18.1% currently and 21.5% in the next six \n",
      "months. This contrasts with Construction (NAICS 23) with a current use rate of 1.4% and \n",
      "2.2% in the next six months. High use states include those in the west (Colorado, Nevada, \n",
      "Utah, California, Arizona, Washington) and some in the east (Florida, Delaware, \n",
      "Massachusetts), and the District of Columbia. Low use states include Mississippi, West \n",
      "Virginia, Maine, and North Dakota. The high-use states have roughly double the rates at \n",
      "the low-use states.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.  AI use, while especially high in the largest firms, has a U-shaped pattern with respect to \n",
      "\n",
      "firm size. AI use monotonically declines with firm age on a firm-weighted basis and has a \n",
      "U-shaped relationship on an employment-weighted basis, for current and future use. \n",
      "These patterns together suggest that some AI applications (e.g., Generative AI) may be \n",
      "general purpose technologies that do not involve large fixed costs making it more \n",
      "attractive to young and small firms.   \n",
      "\n",
      "4.  While AI use appears to be generally persistent at the firm level, about one in seven users \n",
      "\n",
      "of AI do not expect to continue to use AI in the near future, potentially indicating some \n",
      "degree of ongoing experimentation or temporary use that may result in de-adoption.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5.  Marketing automation, virtual agents, natural language processing, and data/text analytics \n",
      "appear to be the most widely used AI applications by businesses, and their use will grow \n",

      " \n",
      "\n",
      "26 \n",
      "\n",

      "automation are the dominant types of use. \n",
      "\n",
      "6.  While many businesses use AI to replace worker tasks and existing equipment/software, \n",
      "\n",
      "there is little evidence that AI use is associated with a decline in firm employment. In \n",
      "fact, an increase in employment as a result of AI use is more common than a decrease. \n",
      "While both types of change (increase and decrease) are expected to become more \n",
      "common in the near future, the incidences of these changes will remain low relative to \n",
      "that of no change. Similarly, a substantial fraction of the firms that use AI to replace \n",
      "worker tasks uses it to replace only a small number of worker tasks—a pattern that is \n",
      "expected to remain largely the same in the near future. \n",
      "\n",
      "7.  AI-using businesses generally perform better than non-users and expect to do so in the \n",
      "\n",
      "future. They also more commonly experience employment expansions than contractions \n",
      "compared to non-users. The overall better performance of AI-using businesses is a fact \n",
      "that has repeatedly emerged from the analysis of other data, including data from the ABS \n",
      "and the BFS. \n",

      "workers, developing new workflows, purchasing cloud services/storage, and changing \n",
      "data management/collection practices.  \n",
      "\n",
      "9.  The predominant reason why businesses do not expect to use AI in the near future is the \n",
      "inapplicability of the technology to a business. Lack of knowledge on the capabilities of \n",
      "AI is the second—but far less common—reason.  \n",
